# Stereo Safety and Functionality
### Willow Brockhoff, March 7, 2023

I drive a Volkswagen Cabriolet from 1998. When I purchased the car in 2020, it came with its original stereo. This stereo was easy to use but too outdated to meet my needs. It was equipped with a fully functional casket player but unfortunately, I don’t own any casket tapes. Luckily, I had a cassette adaptor that let me use an aux cord to play music from my phone, but when I updated my phone I could no longer use the cassette adapter either.

I decided to upgrade and installed a JVC KD-SX27BT stereo to better suit my needs. It is far more complex than the original stereo. Most of the controls aren’t immediately **visible** and are somewhat hard to locate with there being so many options. Nonetheless, I’ve found my JVC stereo to be easy enough to interact with in most scenarios. However, it is still intimidating enough that I put off doing more complex tasks such as changing the settings.

One issue I’ve run into with my new stereo is that the light coming from it is too bright at night and distracts me while I’m driving. I set out to solve this problem and dim the light and expected to solve it quickly through settings.

When first attempting to move into settings, I found difficulty with the dual-use button that the settings are in. In my **mental model**, pressing the button with the gear icon would open settings that I could then move through. As seen in the video below, the **conceptual model** was different. When I pressed it, it took me to date and time settings that were not linked with the rest of the settings. This **error was easily recoverable** as I wasn’t stuck in the date and time section and was free to leave without. On my third attempt, I held down the button, achieving my goal. As a user, this interaction wasn’t ideal and could have been avoided. Instead of utilizing a dual-use button, moving the date and time settings into the rest of the settings or diverging the options into two different ones would improve the user experience of this stereo.

Once in the rest of the settings, moving through the options lined up perfectly with my **mental model** of the system. Because the dial is the largest button on the stereo, I assumed that is what I needed to use to move. From my previous experience as well as from the **affordances** of this button such as the ribbed texture that covers the edge of the dial, I knew I was able to spin the dial to find different options as well as press it to select things. Once I located and selected the Display settings, I reviewed my options and decided the Dimmer was what I was searching for. The Dimmer settings did not feature a range like dimmers typically would but rather an on/off option. Although this isn't preferable, it accomplished what I needed it to.

Overall, this stereo functions well enough to get the job done but is rather inconvenient to use at times. In addition, this stereo could function **safer** than it currently does. This system is not very **learnable**, meaning it’s not easy to accomplish a task easily on the first attempt. Attempting to do an action for the first time while driving should not be difficult. A driver's main priority is to focus on the road and this stereo should not be so difficult to move about that it is distracting the user and therefore **unsafe**. I would suggest removing dual-use buttons in favor of multiple buttons or more setting options. I would also suggest adding a button that solely functions to turn off the stereo lights as they specifically may be distracting to many drivers. This would make the interaction easy and quick, and not take focus away from the road.
