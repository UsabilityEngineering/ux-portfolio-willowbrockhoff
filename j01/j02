#My roommate recently received a Blendtec blender as a gift. The blender is advertised with many features, such as whipping ice cream, batter, and soup. Our bananas browned before we got to them and for this journal, I set out to make banana bread and put this blender to the test.


#This Blendtec has six settings that are afforded by small pictures. They include a whisk, presumably for batters. A margarita glass is featured, likely for frozen drinks while a cup with a straw is illustrated for smoothies. An ice cream cone clearly displays the ice cream setting, followed by a carrot for juice. The final setting is a steaming bowl of soup. Above these, there are three more controls afforded with a plus sign, a minus sign, and a heartbeat sign.
